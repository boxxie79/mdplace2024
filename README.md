# Murder Drones r/place 2024 Template

To install, download [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=firefox) on your browser of choice, if using mobile please use Firefox.
With Tampermonkey installed, go to [this link](https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager/raw/main/dist/templateManager.user.js) to install the r/place template manager.
You will find a [new config button](https://github.com/boxxie79/mdplace2024/blob/main/tutorial_images/configbutton.png) on the [r/place canvas](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/). Press it, and find the [always load box](https://github.com/boxxie79/mdplace2024/blob/main/tutorial_images/alwaysloadbox.png), then enter the template link.

Unlike last year, the template link will never change, and always be hosted at _raw.githubusercontent.com/???_. If you can't find where we are, check the [#rplace-info](https://discord.com/channels/959878009836404746/) channel in the [Discord](invite link here pls)!

If you're here to make your own template, you're in the wrong [place](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WTiDcRo4P35zJvlgWX06MKVbitbDo3ehnF7mysFv4Y/edit?rm=minimal).
If you would like an alliance, please talk about it in the [#rplace-diplomacy](https://discord.com/channels/959878009836404746/) channel.
It may be disregarded unless we are neighbours on the canvas, or you're representing another Glitch Productions series.


Imagine all this preparation for nothing to happen next year...
