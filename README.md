# Murder Drones r/place 2024 Template

To install, download [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=firefox) on your browser of choice, if you're on mobile please use Firefox.
With Tampermonkey installed, go to [this link](https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager/raw/main/dist/templateManager.user.js) to install the r/place template manager, then reload the r/place tab.
You will find a [new config button](https://github.com/boxxie79/mdplace2024/blob/main/tutorial_images/configbutton.png) on the canvas. Press it, and find the [always load box](https://github.com/boxxie79/mdplace2024/blob/main/tutorial_images/alwaysloadbox.png), then enter the template link.

Unlike last year, the template link will never change, and always be hosted at _raw.githubusercontent.com/???_. It may take a while to update, but it's better than a new template link every 5 seconds.

If you can't find where we are, or would like to get announcements, join the [Discord](invite link here, not giving it out yet.), and check the #rplace-info or #rplace-announcements channel.

If you're here to make your own template, you're in the wrong [place](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12WTiDcRo4P35zJvlgWX06MKVbitbDo3ehnF7mysFv4Y/edit?rm=minimal).
If you would like an alliance, please talk about it in the [#rplace-diplomacy](https://discord.com/channels/959878009836404746/) channel.
It may be disregarded unless we are neighbours on the canvas, or you're representing another Glitch Productions series.

Don't bother with pull requests or issues, just ping someone on Discord if they're online:

Imagine all this preparation for nothing to happen next year...
