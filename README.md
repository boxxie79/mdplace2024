# Murder Drones r/place 2024 Template

To install, download [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=firefox) on your browser of choice, if you're on mobile please use Firefox.
With Tampermonkey installed, go to [this link](https://github.com/osuplace/templateManager/raw/main/dist/templateManager.user.js) to install the r/place template manager, then reload the r/place tab.
You will find a [new config button](https://github.com/boxxie79/mdplace2024/blob/main/tutorial_images/configbutton.png) on the canvas. Press it, and find the [always load box](https://github.com/boxxie79/mdplace2024/blob/main/tutorial_images/alwaysloadbox.png), then enter the template link.

Unlike last year, the template link will never change.
